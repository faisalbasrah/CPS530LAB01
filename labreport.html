<h1>Technical Report</h1>

<p>The actual printout of the code prints my full name along with my student number. It then prints out a list of courses students are taking the semester for computer science. Since i am completely new to html, all the tags were new to me so i used the paragraph tag to implement a paragraph into the site. The page looks similar on all webpages. I spent approximately 3 hours on the lab due to it being my first interaction with this code. The page is not password protected as I could not figure out the method for that. </p>
